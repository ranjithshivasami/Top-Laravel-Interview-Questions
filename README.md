3. do a broadcast
4. hit an api

the request goes to index.php (which usually is in the /public folder or the root folder).

Use the  $queue  variable in the code.
```
class CustomJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public $queue = 'custom_queue'; // Specify the custom queue name here

    /**
     * Execute the job.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        // Logic for the job execution
    }
}
In the above code, we have a CustomJob class that implements the ShouldQueue interface, indicating that the job should be pushed onto a queue for asynchronous processing.

By adding the $queue property to the job class and assigning it a custom queue name (in this case, 'custom_queue'), you can specify the desired queue for the job.

Remember to update the namespace and handle method with your specific logic for the job execution.

Once you dispatch this job, it will be added to the specified queue and processed accordingly.
